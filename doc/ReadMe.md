# User Tutorial

If you want to use a mod (Furniture Pack) that was made for this Framework, you just need to install the latest version of the mod available on [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/23458?tab=files).

# Author Tutorial

Here is [the documentation](https://github.com/Leroymilo/FurnitureFramework/blob/main/doc/Author.md) on how to create a Furniture Pack.  
Here's a list of published mods using this Framework:
- [Lynn's Livingroom](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/23677)

If you are a C# mod author and need an API for this mod, you can either make it and ask for a merge request, or ping me on the SV discord server, I should be able to make it for you.
